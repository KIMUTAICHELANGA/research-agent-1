environmental degradation.\"", \""CK, founder of Rongbient, wants to improve both sides of this equation with the help of a new model that uses seaweeds as a biofilter, a feed ingredient and as an extra revenue source for small-scale farmers.\"", \""\\nby\\nSteven Hermans\\nSeaweed industry analyst\\nRongbient's founder, Cuong Ha (who is widely known as CK) in discussion with some of the Rongbient team\\n\\u00a9 Rongbient\\nWhen confronted with the facts about\\nshrimp\\nfarming in\\nVietnam\\n, it\\u2019s hard not to conclude that the sector remains highly inefficient, at the same time struggling to contain its negative effects on the environment.\"", \""One tonne of shrimp from intensive farms is responsible for\\n14 tonnes of carbon emissions\\n, while feeds are imported and antibiotic use is high, resulting in production costs double those of top competitor\\nEcuador\\n.\"", \""\\nOn the other hand, the extensive farming done by smallholder farmers has no water treatment and is acutely unproductive: as a result, less than a third of shrimp survive, farmers earn very little, ponds are degraded and waste is directly released into the environment.\"", \""\\nOn top of that, due to the preponderance of extensive farming, land use for shrimp ponds in Vietnam is considerable as well.\"", \""At nearly 750,000 hectares, it\\u2019s about three times as much as Ecuador, even if production is lower.\"", \""\\nShort on time?\"", \""Watch this summary video\\n\\u201cThose were the questions that started\\nRongbient\\n,\\u201d says CK: \\u201chow can we improve the productivity of these lands and raise farmer\\u2019s incomes, while at the same time reducing costs for intensive farms and the associated environmental impact?\"", \""Seaweeds, Gracilaria in particular, then emerged as our solution.\\u201d\"", \""\\nA new way to grow Gracilaria\\nIndonesia has been the biggest grower of Gracilaria for decades, supplying the world\\u2019s agar industry.\"", \""Traditionally, Gracilaria is grown at the bottom of a pond, often with the addition of fertilisers to speed up the process.\"", \""\\nRongbient instead uses a net structure on top of the shrimp pond.\"", \""As CK explains: \\u201cWe decided on the surface net to access direct sunlight and improve the growth rate.\"", \""It needed to be quite a fine mesh as well, because Gracilaria breaks easily, and you could potentially lose a lot of biomass to the bottom of the pond.\"", \""Of course, because of the polyculture with shrimp, we don\\u2019t need to add the extra nutrients like they do in Indonesia.\"", \""\\n\\u201cWith our first test we got to a growth rate of roughly 2.5 percent per day.\"", \""We are at 3.2 percent a day now, but we know there is room for improvement - we haven\\u2019t even started optimising the strain yet.\\u201d\"", \""\\nThe startup uses a rental system to encourage adoption. \\u201c\"", \""We don't ask farmers to drastically change the way they do things.\"", \""We throw the cultivation system on top of the pond and let it grow.\"", \""Every two months, we come and pick up the harvest.\"", \""There are no upfront costs, the farmer only pays us the rental fee at harvest time,\\u201d says CK.\"", \""\\n\\u201cWe have a few hectares under cultivation now as a pilot, and we have been able to double farmers\\u2019 income thanks to seaweed sales and improved shrimp survival rate, from 33 percent to 42 percent.\\u201d\"", \""he adds.\"", \""\\nRongbient uses a novel technique involving surface nets to grow Gracilaria in its shrimp ponds\\n\\u00a9 Rongbient\\nFeeding it back\\nPost-harvest, Rongbient processes the seaweeds into a feed additive for intensive shrimp farms.\"", \""Seaweed-based feed additives are slowly gaining traction across Asia as they are showing good results in\\nreducing the prevalence of EHP, WFS and EMS\\n, at the same time\\nimproving FCR\\n, with the potential to even\\nfight off Vibrio\\n.\"", \""\\nIn Vietnam, Rongbient has seen similar positive results in its pilot.\"", \""CK expands: \\u201cWe have seen survival rate increase.\"", \""Production grew by anywhere between 5 and 8 percent.\"", \""Although we have seen a drop in feed conversion ratio, our main focus is on the feed additives: antibiotics, probiotics, et cetera.\"", \""So far, we have managed to reduce usage by 20 percent.\"", \""\\n\\u201cWe are about to start a pilot with one of the largest shrimp exporters to get more data and improve those numbers.\"", \""We aim to cut down additives use by 50 percent if we get the resources to engineer the product.\"", \""\\n\\u201cThe cost structure of shrimp farming in Vietnam is 50 to 70 percent for feed, with additives accounting for another 20 to 30 percent.\"", \""If you can cut 50 percent of those additives, it would mean 10 to 15 percent of the total cost.\"", \""That is close to a farmer\\u2019s yearly profit margin.\"", \""If we can also increase the survival rate a bit, we can effectively double farmers\\u2019 profits.\"", \""That\\u2019s our value proposition.\"", \""\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s worth mentioning that the use of banned antibiotics regularly leads to refused imports of Vietnamese shrimp in the US and EU, so this is about more than just cost savings.\\u201d\"", \""\\nA bumper crop of Gracilaria, ready for processing\\n\\u00a9

demand.\"", \""\\nCK says: \\u201cWe started in C\\u00e0 Mau in the Mekong Delta where we have several hectares under cultivation now.\"", \""We are rolling out a few more hectares over the next quarter to build more traction and revenue.\"", \""\\nOur government partners have been really positive about our system.\"", \""They told us: \\u2018if you can double our shrimp farmers\\u2019

intricate realities of seaweed farming in different contexts.\"", \""\\nAlthough challenges such as warming waters and extreme weather events affect many commercially farmed species, each species and market faces unique issues.\"", \""To better understand the current state of global seaweed production, we can categorise these challenges into four key dimensions: temperate versus tropical seaweeds and emerging versus established farming regions.\"", \""\\nShort on time?\"", \""Watch this summary video\\nTemperate vs tropical seaweeds\\nCultivating seaweed in the tropical belt is radically different compared to the temperate zones.\"", \""Tropical seaweeds, such as Gracilaria and Eucheumatoids, allow for year-round production with growth cycles of only 30 to 45 days.\"", \""This quick turnaround enables farmers to initiate, increase, or pause production in response to market trends or external factors.\"", \""In contrast, temperate seaweeds are typically seasonal crops, primarily farmed during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in Southern Hemisphere.\"", \""For example, kelps are seeded and harvested only once a year, with relatively short time windows for these activities.\"", \""While Pyropia can be partially harvested throughout the season, it is highly perishable in its unprocessed form, necessitating processing facilities that can extend operations.\"", \""Farmers of temperate species must thus meticulously plan ahead to ensure that their harvests align with market demand.\"", \""\\nWhether they\\u2019re tropical or temperate has many other implications for the farming practices.\"", \""Here are two of the more distinct ones:\\nIn temperate zones, the seasonal nature of production requires a land-based hatchery stage to produce seed material for the following farming cycle.\"", \""The\\nland-based\\nstage for temperate seaweed ensured investment into seedbanks and hatchery work, with the selection of the best-performing crop and improved seed material being available to farmers, either through cooperative hatchery operations (such as used in Japan) or privately owned hatchery operations (such ad used in South Korea).\"", \""In contrast, tropical seaweeds do not necessarily require this step and have predominantly relied on clonal propagation since farming began in the 1970s.\"", \""The lack of a similar infrastructure for tropical seaweeds has resulted in a decreased pool of genetic diversity, making crops more vulnerable to pests, diseases and climate change effects.\"", \""\\nMost tropical seaweed farming regions - such as Indonesia (pictured above) - rely on manpower for landing harvested seaweed\\nThis is in marked contrast to the mechanical means used by kelp farmers in regions like South Korea (see first image in this feature)\\n\\u00a9 Karlotta Rieve\\nPain points for the seaweed industry differ in different regions (click on image to enlarge)\\n\\u00a9 Hatch Intelligence Services\\nAnother significant difference is in post-harvest handling methods.\"", \""Sun drying is the most common method for stabilising biomass in tropical regions due to high sunlight exposure year-round.\"", \""However, this relatively low-cost technique often leads to minimal innovation in processing steps and product development.\"", \""Furthermore, sun drying can destroy valuable compounds in the seaweed.\"", \""On the other hand, temperate regions face challenges related to having short weather windows for harvesting large amounts of biomass simultaneously.\"", \""This has driven farmers to explore diverse alternatives to drying \\u2013 especially given the high energy requirements involved \\u2013 leading to the exploration of more diverse and innovative product applications.\"", \""\\nLastly, a strong differentiating factor between tropical and temperate seaweed farming lies in their socio-economic contexts.\"", \""Tropical seaweed farming often occurs in developing countries within the global South and is dominated by smallholder farmers who operate small farms in less regulated environments.\"", \""For many coastal communities in these regions, seaweed farming is one of the few sources of livelihood, increasing their dependency on this activity while also exposing them to exploitation risks.\"", \""\\nIn contrast, temperate regions\\u2014typically found in developed countries within the global North\\u2014feature more company-type farming businesses due to more regulated access to farming.\"", \""Farmers do have other economic opportunities, so seaweed becomes either a \\u201cside gig\\u201d as we witness in many North American emerging seaweed farming regions, or the next generations of farmers are lacking due to more attractive employment opportunities in the cities, such as the Japanese and South Korean trends show.\"", \""\\nTypical off-bottom tropical seaweed farm in Indonesia\\n\\u00a9 Karlotta Rieve\\nEmerging vs established seaweed farming regions\\nWhen comparing established versus emerging seaweed farming regions, we see that established areas tend to exhibit a market pull that facilitates scale.\"", \""For instance, East Asia has a long-standing cultural appreciation for seaweed as a staple food source.\"", \""Similarly, Southeast Asia has experienced increased global demand for carrageenan and agar derived from cultivated seaweeds.\"", \""In both cases, markets were initially supplied by wild-harvested seaweed; however, demand quickly outpaced supply, justifying the development of farming.\"", \""\\nConversely, many emerging seaweed farming regions perceive aquaculture as an opportunity for people, planet and profit but often lack a clear market pull to justify increased farming operations.\"", \""This situation is frequently compounded by stringent regulatory environments due to the novelty of the activity and limited room for error.\"", \""When seaweed farming began in now-established regions around 50 years ago, there were fewer regulations; now that these markets have matured, they tend to navigate existing businesses and supply chains.\"", \""\\nHatch Innovation Services, in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy, recently conducted a deep dive into policy frameworks for seaweed aquaculture across emerging, growing, and established seaweed farming nations to provide policy recommendations for nations at different stages of their seaweed industry development.\"", \""The second part of this article series will share some of the findings.\"", \""\\nIn the third part, we will give our view on seaweed production trends.\"", \""Since, of course there are also many nuances within the four categories presented here, we will go a bit more in-depth and share our predictions about where we can expect most of the seaweed biomass in the near future to come from.\"", \""\\nConclusion\\nTo conclude this part, I suggest that we should go beyond talking about one generic seaweed industry.\"", \""While discussing specific species may not always be practical, the four dimensions are presented instead.\"", \""This approach will elevate conversations among stakeholders who strive to address the challenges faced by their respective seaweed sectors and apply targeted solutions tailored to their unique contexts.\"", \""The most significant challenges from our

to your routine.\"", \""\\nDr. Wong says that dry, dehydrated and normal skin types will benefit from marula oil most, and warns that it isn't always suitable for those with oily skin. \\\""\"", \""It has a high ratio of oleic and linoleic acids, meaning it's potentially more comodogenic (pore-blocking) compared to oils with a lower linoleic acid content,\\\"" she explains.\"", \""\\nDr. Phillips adds that \\u201cthose who are prone to acne should also use caution, as it may be too rich for their skin and trigger breakouts.\\u201d\"", \""\\nDr. Wong advises applying the oil straight on to bare

attention in 2018 with the UK arrival ofDrunk Elephant, the cult American skincare brand adored by Instagram users and beauty aficionados alike.\"", \""It's laced through the entire line: brand founder Tiffany Masterson believes it to be superior to anyoilshe's tried and preaches a host of skin benefits, not least from its high content of fatty acids and antioxidants.\"", \""\\nShe's not alone.\"", \""Now it's not only the soothing companion in yourretinol serum, but also in your detangling hair spray, gradual tan and body lotions.\"", \""\\nWondering where to start?\"", \""We spoke to expert dermatologists and hair stylists for everything you need to know about this magic, multipurpose ingredient.\"", \""\\n\\\""Marula oil is extracted from either the nut, seeds or fruit of the African Marula Tree,\\\"" says consultant dermatologistDr.\"", \""Sharon Wong.\"", \""\\nAnd while other parts of the Marula Tree are used for food and medicinal purposes, since bursting onto the beauty scene, its oil has been especially recognised for its lightweight formula and hydrating properties.\"", \""As it\\u2019s non-greasy, hydrating and has a fruity scent with a slight nutty undertone, it's especially useful as a treat for skin and hair in need of a boost.\"", \""\\nAs it\\u2019s rich in antioxidants and fatty acids, marula oil is best for nourishing the skin. \\u201c\"", \""It helps to soothe dry, irritated skin by supporting the skin barrier and locking in moisture,\\u201d says consultant dermatologistDr.\"", \""Derrick Phillips.\"", \""\\n\\\""Marula oil helps to reduce the amount of water that is lost from the skin by forming a lightweight layer,\\u201d explains Dr. Wong. \\u201c\"", \""Key amino acids (L-arginine and glutamic acid) then work hard to trap moisture into the skin.\\u201d\"", \""A hydrated skin barrier means bouncy, luminous looking skin, while fewer dry patches means that makeup also sits nicely on top.\"", \""\\nAs for marula oil's antioxidant properties, it works hard to protect skin (on the body, as well as the face) from environmental damage, making it perfect for city dwellers and sunbathers alike. \\\""\"", \""It's rich inVitamin Cand E, and phytochemicals called catechins,\\\"" says Dr. Wong. \\\""\"", \""These antioxidant effects help to combat damaging oxidative stress and free radicals caused by pollution and UV rays.\\\""\"", \""\\nEven better, marula oil also has greatanti-ageingbenefits. \\u201c\"", \""It can slow down the loss ofcollagenand elastin, two important proteins for maintaining skin elasticity and preventing the development of fine lines and wrinkles,\\u201d explains Dr. Phillips.\"", \""Helping to protect the structure and bounce that comes with youthful skin, marula oil is a great youth-preserver to add to your routine.\"", \""\\nDr. Wong says that dry, dehydrated and normal skin types will benefit from marula oil most, and warns that it isn't always suitable for those with oily skin. \\\""\"", \""It has a high ratio of oleic and linoleic acids, meaning it's potentially more comodogenic (pore-blocking) compared to oils with a lower linoleic acid content,\\\"" she explains.\"", \""\\nDr. Phillips adds that \\u201cthose who are prone to acne should also use caution, as it may be too rich for their skin and trigger breakouts.\\u201d\"", \""\\nDr. Wong advises applying the oil straight on to bare skin after cleansing, unless you're also using a toner, essence or water-based serum, in which case follow the rule of 'thin to thick' and apply those first, then apply your oil.\"", \""As always, follow with anymoisturisersand anSPF.\"", \""\\nAs for frequency, marula oil is safe to be used daily \\u2013 Dr. Phillips recommends either in the morning or evening as part of your skincare routine. \\u201c\"", \""It works well with serums likehyaluronic acidfor added hydration, but should not be layered with heavy oils, to avoid overloading the skin,\\u201d he says.\"", \""\\nTo use in haircare, add a few drops of oil to yourshampooorconditioner, or apply a touch to dry hair and brush through with fingers or a comb.\"", \""\\\""As it's packed with amino acids, marula oil can help to improve shine and fullness.\"", \""It's great for taming frizz, flyaways and dry ends - without weighing hair down.\\\""\"", \""says Dr. Wong.\"", \""\\nMarula oil in its

with the help of a new model that uses seaweeds as a biofilter, a feed ingredient and as an extra revenue source for small-scale farmers."", ""\nby\nSteven Hermans\nSeaweed industry analyst\nRongbient's founder, Cuong Ha (who is widely known as CK) in discussion with some of the Rongbient team\n\u00a9 Rongbient\nWhen confronted with the facts about\nshrimp\nfarming in\nVietnam\n, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that the sector remains highly inefficient, at the same time struggling to contain its negative effects on the environment."", ""One tonne of shrimp from intensive farms is responsible for\n14 tonnes of carbon emissions\n, while feeds are imported and antibiotic use is high, resulting in production costs double those of top competitor\nEcuador\n."", ""\nOn the other hand, the extensive farming done by smallholder farmers has no water treatment and is acutely unproductive: as a result, less than a third of shrimp survive, farmers earn very little, ponds are degraded and waste is directly released into the environment."", ""\nOn top of that, due to the preponderance of extensive farming, land use for shrimp ponds in Vietnam is considerable as well."", ""At nearly 750,000 hectares, it\u2019s about three times as much as Ecuador, even if production is lower."", ""\nShort on time?"", ""Watch this summary video\n\u201cThose were the questions that started\nRongbient\n,\u201d says CK: \u201chow can we improve the productivity of these lands and raise farmer\u2019s incomes, while at the same time reducing costs for intensive farms and the associated environmental impact?"", ""Seaweeds, Gracilaria in particular, then emerged as our solution.\u201d"", ""\nA new way to grow Gracilaria\nIndonesia has been the biggest grower of Gracilaria for decades, supplying the world\u2019s agar industry."", ""Traditionally, Gracilaria is grown at the bottom of a pond, often with the addition of fertilisers to speed up the process."", ""\nRongbient instead uses a net structure on top of the shrimp pond."", ""As CK explains: \u201cWe decided on the surface net to access direct sunlight and improve the growth rate."", ""It needed to be quite a fine mesh as well, because Gracilaria breaks easily, and you could potentially lose a lot of biomass to the bottom of the pond."", ""Of course, because of the polyculture with shrimp, we don\u2019t need to add the extra nutrients like they do in Indonesia."", ""\n\u201cWith our first test we got to a growth rate of roughly 2.5 percent per day."", ""We are at 3.2 percent a day now, but we know there is room for improvement - we haven\u2019t even started optimising the strain yet.\u201d"", ""\nThe startup uses a rental system to encourage adoption. \u201c"", ""We don't ask farmers to drastically change the way they do things."", ""We throw the cultivation system on top of the pond and let it grow."", ""Every two months, we come and pick up the harvest."", ""There are no upfront costs, the farmer only pays us the rental fee at harvest time,\u201d says CK."", ""\n\u201cWe have a few hectares under cultivation now as a pilot, and we have been able to double farmers\u2019 income thanks to seaweed sales and improved shrimp survival rate, from 33 percent to 42 percent.\u201d"", ""he adds."", ""\nRongbient uses a novel technique involving surface nets to grow Gracilaria in its

traction across Asia as they are showing good results in\nreducing the prevalence of EHP, WFS and EMS\n, at the same time\nimproving FCR\n, with the potential to even\nfight off Vibrio\n."", ""\nIn Vietnam, Rongbient has seen similar positive results in its pilot."", ""CK expands: \u201cWe have seen survival rate increase."", ""Production grew by anywhere between 5 and 8 percent."", ""Although we have seen a drop in feed conversion ratio, our main focus is on the feed additives: antibiotics, probiotics, et cetera."", ""So far, we have managed to reduce usage by 20 percent."", ""\n\u201cWe are about to start a pilot with one of the largest shrimp exporters to get more data and improve those numbers."", ""We aim to cut down additives use by 50 percent if we get the resources to engineer the product."", ""\n\u201cThe cost structure of shrimp farming in Vietnam is 50 to 70 percent for feed, with additives accounting for another 20 to 30 percent."", ""If you can cut 50 percent of those additives, it would mean 10 to 15 percent of the total cost."", ""That is close to a farmer\u2019s yearly profit margin."", ""If we can also increase the survival rate a bit, we can effectively double farmers\u2019 profits."", ""That\u2019s our value proposition."", ""\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the use of banned antibiotics regularly leads to refused imports of Vietnamese shrimp in the

where we have several hectares under cultivation now."", ""We are rolling out a few more hectares over the next quarter to build more traction and revenue."", ""\nOur government partners have been really positive about our system."", ""They told us: \u2018if you can double our shrimp farmers\u2019 income, we want this in our communities."", ""If you can scale it to 20,000-30,000 hectares, that's good enough for us."", ""But if you can do more, that would be even better.\u2019"", ""\nShrimp farms in C\u00e0 Mau cover 280,000 hectares, so the potential is massive.\u201d"", ""\nWhile initial results have so far been very positive, finding the funds to scale up the solution is proving to be challenging."", ""\nAs CK notes: \u201dWe are currently trying to raise 500,000 dollars in a pre-seed round to scale supply and improve our processing, but Vietnam is seen as too risky or too small a market for international investors, while local investors often prefer a concept that has already been proven abroad and that can be adapted to the local context."", ""\n\u201cFor someone coming from a software background like myself, trying to find the funding for a real-world solution

kangaroos."", ""\nTraci Klarenbeek/Megafauna Central\nhide caption\ntoggle caption\nTraci Klarenbeek/Megafauna Central\nTens of thousands of years ago, during the late Pleistocene, many large animal species were simply erased from the planet during a widespread extinction."", ""\n\""It's a question that's been plaguing paleontology for a couple of hundred years,\"" says Sam Arman, a paleontologist at\nMegafauna Central\n, a natural history museum in Australia\nNow, in research published in\nScience\n, Arman and his colleagues say that a detailed analysis of hundreds of ancient and modern kangaroo teeth point to the arrival of humans in Australia playing a larger role in the extinction event than a changing climate."", ""\nSponsor Message\nNot everyone agrees, however. \"""", ""I think looking at one spot in time is not enough to discount the role that climate may play in previous extinctions,\"" says\nLarisa DeSantis\n, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University who wasn't involved with the study."", ""\nThe question of human- versus climate-induced extinction is an important one since it could help researchers disentangle the forces today that are contributing to the erasure of global biodiversity."", ""Then, around eight million years ago, \""Australia became quite arid,\"" says Arman."", ""\nIn response, kangaroos adapted their locomotion and diets to the drier climate. \"""", ""That was where kangaroos really hit their strides \u2014 or I suppose their hops \u2014 and diversified into a lot of different groups,\""says Arman."", ""\nThere were two major groups of kangaroos."", ""There were the long-faced ones, \""which is what you still see today, and that includes things like wallabies,\"" says Arman."", ""And there were the short-faced ones. \"""", ""If you plunked a koala head on top of it, you're basically in the right ballpark, just less floofy.\"""", ""\nAll these kangaroos lived alongside an array of other animals. \"""", ""We had this marsupial that was the size of a rhino,\"" Arman says. \"""", ""We had a marsupial lion."", ""We had all sorts of crazy things.\"""", ""\nSponsor Message\nThen, about 40,000 to 65,000 years ago, most of these large animal species went extinct, including all of the short-faced kangaroos and some of the long-faced kangaroos."", ""And the question is \u2014 why?"", ""\n\""It really does come down to two arguments,\"" says Arman."", ""\nThe first is whether humans \u2014 who arrived in Australia around this time \u2014 had something to do with it, perhaps by hunting the kangaroos or altering the landscape."", ""\nThe second is related to a change in climate. \"""", ""If these kangaroos were all just feeding on particular sorts of plants,\"" says Arman, \""then perhaps climate change came in and wiped out those plants and then they went extinct because of that.\"""", ""\nAncient marsupial dentistry\nThis idea that their food disappearing leading to extinction relies on the kangaroos having been specialized eaters."", ""Some paleontologists argue this was the case based on differences in kangaroo skull shape and chemistry \u2014 that short-faced kangaroos fed primarily on shrubs and long-faced kangaroos fed mostly on grasses."", ""\nArman, however, wasn't so sure. \"""", ""Adaptation does not necessarily define diet,\"" he says."", ""He approached the question of ancient kangaroo extinction by taking a detailed look at the teeth of more than 900 kangaroos \u2014 a mix of fossils from Victoria Fossil Cave in South Australia and modern animals from across the country."", ""\nThe technique is called dental microwear texture analysis. \"""", ""Whenever an animal chews its food,\"" Arman explains, \""the food leaves marks \u2014 microscopic scratches on the surface of the teeth."", ""If we take those teeth and scan them under a very high resolution microscope, we can then compare what these fossil animals were eating at the time.\"""", ""\nArman and his colleagues found that most of the extinct kangaroos (both the short- and long-faced ones) had mixed diets."", ""That is, he says they ate both grasses and shrubs based on what was available."", ""The takeaway, Arman suggests, is that starvation brought on by a changing climate may not have wiped out all those kangaroos."", ""Instead, the arrival of humans may have."", ""\nSponsor Message\n\""It doesn't rule out that climate change is involved in some other way,\"" says Arman, \""but it's very hard to tell the story without invoking humans in any way.\"""", ""\nDeSantis says that in Australia, it's difficult to reconstruct what animals once ate in part because of the diverse landscape. \"""", ""This paper is really helpful,\"" she says, \""but I think it goes a little bit too far \u2014 that these kangaroos were already well adapted to variable climate change.\"""", ""\nShe leans towards climate change having more to do with their extinctions. \"""", ""I think you can have a tipping point,\"" she says. \"""", ""If things get warm enough, dry enough, these animals are going to have a tough time making it, regardless of whether they're mixed feeders.\"""", ""\nDeSantis says the new research doesn't capture the full picture. \"""", ""It's really important to see if we can disentangle the impacts of climate and humans in the past,\"" she says, \""so that we can better understand and anticipate the impacts that we're having on current ecosystems.\"""", ""\nThis is a point that Sam Arman agrees with."", ""He's hopeful that his current and future work might lead to ways to help modern-day kangaroos \u2014 particularly if the animals can adapt to eating more kinds of plants and live in more habitats than researchers once thought."", ""\n\""Especially for some of our species that are becoming rarer,\"" he says, \""we can actually consider looking at reintroductions in places where we might think that they'd be poorly adapted.\"""", ""\nIn other words, Arman hopes the kangaroos that ended their time on Earth in the Pleistocene might help the kangaroos of today escape a similar fate."", ""\nMerinda Campbell/MAGNT\nNew study challenges a major theory on why

during the late Pleistocene, many large animal species were simply erased from the planet during a widespread extinction."", ""\n\""It's a question that's been plaguing paleontology for a couple of hundred years,\"" says Sam Arman, a paleontologist at\nMegafauna Central\n, a natural history museum in Australia\nNow, in research published in\nScience\n, Arman and his colleagues say that a detailed analysis of hundreds of ancient and modern kangaroo teeth point to the arrival of humans in Australia playing a larger role in the extinction event than a changing climate."", ""\nSponsor Message\nNot everyone agrees, however. \"""", ""I think looking at one spot in time is not enough to discount the role that climate may play in previous extinctions,\"" says\nLarisa DeSantis\n, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University who wasn't involved with the study."", ""\nThe question of human- versus climate-induced extinction is an important one since it could help researchers disentangle the forces today that are contributing to the erasure of global biodiversity."", ""Then, around eight million years ago, \""Australia became quite arid,\"" says Arman."", ""\nIn response, kangaroos adapted their locomotion and diets to the drier climate. \"""", ""That was where kangaroos really hit their strides \u2014 or I suppose their hops \u2014 and diversified into a lot of different groups,\""says Arman."", ""\nThere were two major groups of kangaroos."", ""There were the long-faced ones, \""which is what you still see today, and that includes things like wallabies,\"" says Arman."", ""And there were the short-faced ones. \"""", ""If you plunked a koala head on top of it, you're basically in the right ballpark, just less floofy.\"""", ""\nAll these kangaroos lived alongside an array of other animals. \"""", ""We had this marsupial that was the size of a rhino,\"" Arman says. \"""", ""We had a marsupial lion."", ""We had all sorts of crazy things.\"""", ""\nSponsor Message\nThen, about 40,000 to 65,000 years ago, most of these large animal species went extinct, including all of the short-faced kangaroos and some of the long-faced kangaroos."", ""And the question is \u2014 why?"", ""\n\""It really does come down to two arguments,\"" says Arman."", ""\nThe first is whether humans \u2014 who arrived in Australia around this time \u2014 had something to do with it, perhaps by hunting the kangaroos or altering the landscape."", ""\nThe second is related to a change in climate. \"""", ""If these kangaroos were all just feeding on particular sorts of plants,\"" says Arman, \""then perhaps climate change came in and wiped out those plants and then they went extinct because of that.\"""", ""\nAncient marsupial dentistry\nThis idea that their food disappearing leading to extinction relies on the kangaroos having been specialized eaters."", ""Some paleontologists argue this was the case based on differences in kangaroo skull shape and chemistry \u2014 that short-faced kangaroos fed primarily on shrubs and long-faced kangaroos fed mostly on grasses."", ""\nArman, however, wasn't so sure. \"""", ""Adaptation does not necessarily define diet,\"" he says."", ""He approached the question of ancient kangaroo extinction by taking a detailed look at the teeth of more than 900 kangaroos \u2014 a mix of fossils from Victoria Fossil Cave in South Australia and modern animals from across the country."", ""\nThe technique is called dental microwear texture analysis. \"""", ""Whenever an animal chews its food,\"" Arman explains, \""the food leaves marks \u2014 microscopic scratches on the surface of the teeth."", ""If we take those teeth and scan them under a very high resolution microscope, we can then compare what these fossil animals were eating at the time.\"""", ""\nArman and his colleagues found that most of the extinct kangaroos (both the short- and long-faced ones) had mixed diets."", ""That is, he says they ate both grasses and shrubs based on what was available."", ""The takeaway, Arman suggests, is that starvation brought on by a changing climate may not have wiped out all those kangaroos."", ""Instead, the arrival of humans may have."", ""\nSponsor Message\n\""It doesn't rule out that climate change is involved in some other way,\"" says Arman, \""but it's very hard to tell the story without invoking humans in any way.\"""", ""\nDeSantis says that in Australia, it's difficult to reconstruct what animals once ate in part because of the diverse landscape. \"""", ""This paper is really helpful,\"" she says, \""but I think it goes a little bit too far \u2014 that these kangaroos were already well adapted to variable climate change.\"""", ""\nShe leans towards climate change having more to do with their extinctions. \"""", ""I think you can have a tipping point,\"" she says. \"""", ""If things get warm enough, dry enough, these animals are going to have a tough time making it, regardless of whether they're mixed feeders.\"""", ""\nDeSantis says the new research doesn't capture the full picture. \"""", ""It's really important to see if we can disentangle the impacts of climate and humans in the past,\"" she says, \""so that we can better understand and anticipate the impacts that we're having on current ecosystems.\"""", ""\nThis is a point that Sam Arman agrees with."", ""He's hopeful that his current and future work might lead to ways to help modern-day kangaroos \u2014 particularly if the animals can adapt to eating more kinds of plants and live in more habitats than researchers once thought."", ""\n\""Especially for some of our species that are becoming rarer,\"" he says, \""we can actually consider looking at reintroductions in places where we might think that they'd be poorly adapted.\"""", ""\nIn other words, Arman hopes the kangaroos that ended their time on Earth in the Pleistocene might help the kangaroos of today escape a similar fate."", ""\nMerinda

different contexts."", ""\nAlthough challenges such as warming waters and extreme weather events affect many commercially farmed species, each species and market faces unique issues."", ""To better understand the current state of global seaweed production, we can categorise these challenges into four key dimensions: temperate versus tropical seaweeds and emerging versus established farming regions."", ""\nShort on time?"", ""Watch this summary video\nTemperate vs tropical seaweeds\nCultivating seaweed in the tropical belt is radically different compared to the temperate zones."", ""Tropical seaweeds, such as Gracilaria and Eucheumatoids, allow for year-round production with growth cycles of only 30 to 45 days."", ""This quick turnaround enables farmers to initiate, increase, or pause production in response to market trends or external factors."", ""In contrast, temperate seaweeds are typically seasonal crops, primarily farmed during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in Southern Hemisphere."", ""For example, kelps are seeded and harvested only once a year, with relatively short time windows for these activities."", ""While Pyropia can be partially harvested throughout the season, it is highly perishable in its unprocessed form, necessitating processing facilities that can extend operations."", ""Farmers of temperate species must thus meticulously plan ahead to ensure that their harvests align with market demand."", ""\nWhether they\u2019re tropical or temperate has many other implications for the farming practices."", ""Here are two of the more distinct ones:\nIn temperate zones, the seasonal nature of production requires a land-based hatchery stage to produce seed material for the following farming cycle."", ""The\nland-based\nstage for temperate seaweed ensured investment into seedbanks and hatchery work, with the selection of the best-performing crop and improved seed material being available to farmers, either through cooperative hatchery operations (such as used in Japan) or privately owned hatchery operations (such ad used in South Korea)."", ""In contrast, tropical seaweeds do not necessarily require this step and have predominantly relied on clonal propagation since farming began in the 1970s."", ""The lack of a similar infrastructure for tropical seaweeds has resulted in a decreased pool of genetic diversity, making crops more vulnerable to pests, diseases and climate change effects."", ""\nMost tropical seaweed farming regions - such as Indonesia (pictured above) - rely on manpower for landing harvested seaweed\nThis is in marked contrast to the mechanical means used by kelp farmers in regions like South Korea (see first image in this feature)\n\u00a9 Karlotta Rieve\nPain points for the seaweed industry differ in different regions (click on image to enlarge)\n\u00a9 Hatch Intelligence Services\nAnother significant difference is in post-harvest handling methods."", ""Sun drying is the most common method for stabilising biomass in tropical regions due to high sunlight exposure year-round."", ""However, this relatively low-cost technique often leads to minimal innovation in processing steps and product development."", ""Furthermore, sun drying can destroy valuable compounds in the seaweed."", ""On the other hand, temperate regions face challenges related to having short weather windows for harvesting large amounts of biomass simultaneously."", ""This has driven farmers to explore diverse alternatives to drying \u2013 especially given the high energy requirements involved \u2013 leading to the exploration of more diverse and innovative product applications."", ""\nLastly, a strong differentiating factor between tropical and temperate seaweed farming lies in their socio-economic contexts."", ""Tropical seaweed farming often occurs in developing countries within the global South and is dominated by smallholder farmers who operate small farms in less regulated environments."", ""For many coastal communities in these regions, seaweed farming is one of the few sources of livelihood, increasing their dependency on this activity while also exposing them to exploitation risks."", ""\nIn contrast, temperate regions\u2014typically found in developed countries within the global North\u2014feature more company-type farming businesses due to more regulated access to farming."", ""Farmers do have other economic opportunities, so seaweed becomes either a \u201cside gig\u201d as we witness in many North American emerging seaweed farming regions, or the next generations of farmers are lacking due to more attractive employment opportunities in the cities, such as the Japanese and South Korean trends show."", ""\nTypical off-bottom tropical seaweed farm in Indonesia\n\u00a9 Karlotta Rieve\nEmerging vs established seaweed farming regions\nWhen comparing established versus emerging seaweed farming regions, we see that established areas tend to exhibit a market pull that facilitates scale."", ""For instance, East Asia has a long-standing cultural appreciation for seaweed as a staple food source."", ""Similarly, Southeast Asia has experienced increased global demand for carrageenan and agar derived from cultivated seaweeds."", ""In both cases, markets were initially supplied by wild-harvested seaweed; however, demand quickly outpaced supply, justifying the development of farming."", ""\nConversely, many emerging seaweed farming regions perceive aquaculture as an opportunity for people, planet and profit but often lack a clear market pull to justify increased farming operations."", ""This situation is frequently compounded by stringent regulatory environments due to the novelty of the activity and limited room for error."", ""When seaweed farming began in now-established regions around 50 years ago, there were fewer regulations; now that these markets have matured, they tend to navigate existing businesses and supply chains."", ""\nHatch Innovation Services, in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy, recently conducted a deep dive into policy frameworks for seaweed aquaculture across emerging, growing, and established seaweed farming nations to provide policy recommendations for nations at different stages of their seaweed industry development."", ""The second part of this article series will share some of the findings."", ""\nIn the third part, we will give our view on seaweed production trends."", ""Since, of course there are also many nuances within the four categories presented here, we will go a bit more in-depth and share our predictions about where we can expect most of the seaweed biomass in the near future to come from."", ""\nConclusion\nTo conclude this part, I suggest that we should go beyond talking about one generic seaweed industry."", ""While discussing specific species may not always be practical, the four dimensions are presented instead."", ""This approach will elevate conversations among stakeholders who strive to address the challenges faced by their respective seaweed sectors and apply targeted solutions tailored to their unique contexts."", ""The most significant challenges from our perspective can then be summarised in the following overview."", ""\nSeaweed industry pain points (click on image to enlarge)\n\u00a9
