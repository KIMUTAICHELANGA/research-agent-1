Special immigrant visas are based on special categories, including former U.S. government employees, religious workers, and special immigrant juveniles [[5](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/special-immigrant-juveniles)].\n\nThe Diversity Visa Program is an annual program making a limited number of visas available to persons who meet strict eligibility requirements from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States [[6](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa.html)]. The application process involves petition approval, visa application preparation, and an interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate.\n\nProcessing times vary widely depending on the type of visa and individual circumstances, and supporting documentation is required for all visa applications [[7](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/all-forms)]. Visa quotas and application fees also apply to certain visa categories.\n\nReferences:\n1: [U.S. Department of State - Immigrate](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate.html)\n2: [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services - Family](https://www.uscis.gov/family)\n3: [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services - Working in the United States](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers)\n4: [U.S. Department of State - Adopt](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/adopt.html)\n5: [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services - Humanitarian](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/special-immigrant-juveniles)\n6: [U.S. Department of State - Diversity Visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa.html)\n7: [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services - Forms](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/all-forms)\n\n**1.2 What are the eligibility criteria, application processes, and typical processing times for each type of non-immigrant visa?**\nThe eligibility criteria, application processes, and typical processing times for non-immigrant visas, specifically O-1, O-2, and O-3 visas, are as follows:\n\n**O-1 Visa**: For individuals with extraordinary ability or achievement in sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, or those with extraordinary achievements in the motion picture or television industry [[1](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-with-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement)].
