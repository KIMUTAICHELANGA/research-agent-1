changes in digestive tract enzyme profiles, with adults mainly expressing carbohydrases and lipases', 'A nuanced symbiotic relationship exists between gut microbiota and the host, namely, specific

birds\n25', 'On the other hand, gut microbiota may become a source of pathogenicity and toxicity to the host, thereby facilitating the development of host-specific intestinal immune and detoxification

scientific analysis revealing alarming declines, the Center for Biological Diversity submitted an urgentpetitiontoday asking Mexican officials to protect the chocolate chip sea cucumber under the country’s endangered species law', 'Today’s petition springs from an analysis showing a staggering 90% population decline in less than two decades, primarily due to illegal fishing and overexploitation', '“Time is running out for these quirky but important creatures', 'Mexico urgently needs to crack down on illegal fishing and promote habitat restoration to prevent the total collapse of this sea cucumber population,” said Alejandro Olivera, a senior scientist and Mexico representative at the Center for Biological Diversity', '“Protecting chocolate chip sea cucumbers as a threatened species is a crucial step toward ensuring their survival', '”\nThe chocolate chip sea cucumber, also known as the cookie dough sea cucumber, is found throughout the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the coasts of Florida and Bermuda, extending south to Brazil', 'In Mexico their numbers have plummeted because of legal overfishing followed by massive illegal fishing after a ban on the fishery', 'The animal is dried and exported primarily to Asia where it is consumed for purported health purposes', 'These sea cucumbers typically grow to about the size of a man’s foot and have leathery, bumpy skin adorned with dark brown speckles, resembling chocolate chips in cookie dough', 'The animals have a unique defense mechanism, expelling their insides to distract predators', 'They also play a vital role in marine ecosystems by filtering and recycling nutrients from the seabed', 'The Center’s new scientific analysis reveals the alarming decline of the chocolate chip sea cucumber in the Yucatán Peninsula', 'In addition to historic legal fishing for the species, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has devastated sea cucumber populations, exceeding official quotas by more than 66%', 'Between 2011 and 2018, an estimated 9,708 tons of chocolate chip sea cucumbers were illegally caught, valued at $34 million', 'This rampant overfishing has reduced the species to a mere 10% of its original biomass, according to Mexican government assessments', "The Center's petition seeks immediate protection for the chocolate chip sea cucumber under Mexico's endangered species list", 'If successful, this listing would mandate population monitoring, management plans and stricter regulations to prevent further decline', 'The restrictive policy of Mexico’s Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources, or Semarnat, of limiting proposals to protect imperiled species to specific time periods has caused significant delays in the past, with some petitioners waiting up to 10 years for their proposals to be considered', 'The Center urges Semarnat to take swift action in this case, given the urgent need to protect the dwindling sea cucumber population', 'The Center for Biological Diversity is a national, nonprofit conservation organization with more than 1', '7 million members and online activists dedicated to the protection of endangered species and wild places', 'Endangered sea cucumbers for sale in NYC food markets\nBy\nBlaine Friedlander, Cornell Chronicle\nJune 14, 2024\nAfter surveying food market retailers in three New York City Chinatown districts, Cornell researchers have found genetic evidence that some endangered species of sea cucumbers – considered a pricey but nutritious dried delicacy – are being sold to consumers', 'The researchers collected 103 samples of dried sea cucumbers from retail food shops', 'By using mitochondrial DNA testing, they successfully identified 74 examples of sea cucumbers', 'Eight were classified as brown sea cucumber, Isostichopus fuscus – which is threatened and found on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List due to overharvesting', '“We were able to genetically identify that the endangered species of brown sea cucumbers – around 10% of the sampled retail market – was being sold,” said lead author Jesse Rodenbiker, a former postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment, in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and now an assistant teaching professor\xa0in geography at Rutgers University', '“It suggests that the kind of level at which sea cucumbers are available on the market may pose a threat for biodiversity loss', '”\nThe research, “\nAdvancing One Health in Urban Seafood Markets: A Genetic and Social Analysis of Dried Sea Cucumber in Three New York City Chinatowns\n,” was published April 25 in the journal Sustainability', 'Rodenbiker and undergraduate students conducted retailer surveys and collected sea cucumber samples, and then brought samples to the laboratory of co-author\nNina Overgaard Therkildsen\n, associate professor in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment (CALS)', 'Her laboratory conducts research in conservation genomics and molecular ecology in the ocean environment', 'There are 1,716 known species of sea cucumbers, which are marine invertebrates that behave like vacuum cleaners roaming the sea floor worldwide, Rodenbiker said', 'Of these species, 16 are listed as either vulnerable or endangered', 'In 2021 and 2022, Cornell students Kelly Su ’24 and Erica Ruan ’24 (who speak Mandarin and Cantonese) conducted semi-structured interviews with merchants in Chinese neighborhoods in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens', 'Rodenbiker purchased dried sea cucumbers, usually labeled by originating geographic region – Japan, Mexico and South America', 'In the interviews, the retailers acknowledged limited understanding of where the sea cucumbers originated', 'Consumers are willing to pay premium prices for sea cucumbers, which are added to soups', 'During the survey period, the price for sea cucumber was between $169 and $229 per pound', '“Although the resolution on this pilot study was a bit coarse, we show that the sourcing for sea cucumbers is quite different among shops and different neighborhoods,” said Therkildsen, who is also a faculty fellow at the\nCornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability', '“By no means was this an exhaustive survey, but it suggests differing sourcing patterns', '”\nTherkildsen recognized that even brown sea cucumbers can be harvested legally in certain parts of the world, but there are no genetic tools yet to trace species origination', '“To conduct any enforcement at merchant food shops, we need tools that can assign a specimen back to a region from where they are protected and we are currently working on developing such tools,” she said', 'Rodenbiker indicated a need for more robust point-of-origination training for the retailers, improved labeling in the markets and public outreach to advance the concept of One Health – an idea that humans, animals and the environment are all connected – in urban seafood markets', '“Given that brown sea cucumbers are abundant on the market,” he said, “there is a need for developing genetic markers that can trace geographic origin to determine if a species was legally harvested', '”\nFunding for this research was provided by Cornell Atkinson', 'Energy,

Border Force (ABF) has seized over six tonnes of sea cucumber, in addition to 500kg of other unspecified catch', 'In the most recent seizure, an estimated two tonnes of sea cucumber were seized, before being returned to the sea following consultation with the Australian Fisheries Management Authority', '"ABF is committed to protecting our vulnerable marine resources and delicate ecosystems through the targeting of irregular foreign fishing in Australian waters," Acting Commander Griffin said, in a press release', 'Whilst the magnitude of the unauthorised fishing operations may be alarming, the volume of sea cucumbers being targeted by fishers highlights a clear demand for them - a demand that aquaculture may be able to fulfil whilst leaving wild populations and ecosystems

modern and extinct kangaroos', 'Traci Klarenbeek/Megafauna Central\nhide caption\ntoggle caption\nTraci Klarenbeek/Megafauna Central\nTens of thousands of years ago, during the late Pleistocene, many large animal species were simply erased from the planet during a widespread extinction', "In Australia, nearly two dozen kangaroo species vanished — but the reason hasn't been clear", '"It\'s a question that\'s been plaguing paleontology for a couple of hundred years," says Sam Arman, a paleontologist at\nMegafauna Central\n, a natural history museum in Australia\nNow, in research published in\nScience\n, Arman and his colleagues say that a detailed analysis of hundreds of ancient and modern kangaroo teeth point to the arrival of humans in Australia playing a larger role in the extinction event than a changing climate', 'Sponsor Message\nNot everyone agrees, however', '"I think looking at one spot in time is not enough to discount the role that climate may play in previous extinctions," says\nLarisa DeSantis\n, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University who wasn\'t involved with the study', 'The question of human- versus climate-induced extinction is an important one since it could help researchers disentangle the forces today that are contributing to the erasure of global biodiversity', 'Kangaroo beginnings… and endings\nKangaroos evolved from a possum-like ancestor some 20 million years ago', 'Then, around eight million years ago, "Australia became quite arid," says Arman', 'In response, kangaroos adapted their locomotion and diets to the drier climate', '"That was where kangaroos really hit their strides — or I suppose their hops — and diversified into a lot of different groups,"says Arman', 'There were two major groups of kangaroos', 'There were the long-faced ones, "which is what you still see today, and that includes things like wallabies," says Arman', 'And there were the short-faced ones', '"If you plunked a koala head on top of it, you\'re basically in the right ballpark, just less floofy', '"\nAll these kangaroos lived alongside an array of other animals', '"We had this marsupial that was the size of a rhino," Arman says', '"We had a marsupial lion', 'We had all sorts of crazy things', '"\nSponsor Message\nThen, about 40,000 to 65,000 years ago, most of these large animal species went extinct, including all of the short-faced kangaroos and some of the long-faced kangaroos', 'And the question is — why?\n"It really does come down to two arguments," says Arman', 'The first is whether humans — who arrived in Australia around this time — had something to do with it, perhaps by hunting the kangaroos or altering the landscape', 'The second is related to a change in climate', '"If these kangaroos were all just feeding on particular sorts of plants," says Arman, "then perhaps climate change came in and wiped out those plants and then they went extinct because of that', '"\nAncient marsupial dentistry\nThis idea that their food disappearing leading to extinction relies on the kangaroos having been specialized eaters', 'Some paleontologists argue this was the case based on differences in kangaroo skull shape and chemistry — that short-faced kangaroos fed primarily on shrubs and long-faced kangaroos fed mostly on grasses', "Arman, however, wasn't so sure", '"Adaptation does not necessarily define diet," he says', 'He approached the question of ancient kangaroo extinction by taking a detailed look at the teeth of more than 900 kangaroos — a mix of fossils from Victoria Fossil Cave in South Australia and modern animals from across the country', 'The technique is called dental microwear texture analysis', '"Whenever an animal chews its food," Arman explains, "the food leaves marks — microscopic scratches on the surface of the teeth', 'If we take those teeth and scan them under a very high resolution microscope, we can then compare what these fossil animals were eating at the time', '"\nArman and his colleagues found that most of the extinct kangaroos (both the short- and long-faced ones) had mixed diets', 'That is, he says they ate both grasses and shrubs based on what was available', 'The takeaway, Arman suggests, is that starvation brought on by a changing climate may not have wiped out all those kangaroos', 'Instead, the arrival of humans may have', 'Sponsor Message\n"It doesn\'t rule out that climate change is involved in some other way," says Arman, "but it\'s very hard to tell the story without invoking humans in any way', '"\nDeSantis says that in Australia, it\'s difficult to reconstruct what animals once ate in part because of the diverse landscape', '"This paper is really helpful," she says, "but I think it goes a little bit too far — that these kangaroos were already well adapted to variable climate change', '"\nShe leans towards climate change having more to do with their extinctions', '"I think you can have a tipping point," she says', '"If things get warm enough, dry enough, these animals are going to have a tough time making it, regardless of whether they\'re mixed feeders', '"\nDeSantis says the new research doesn\'t capture the full picture', '"It\'s really important to see if we can disentangle the impacts of climate and humans in the past," she says, "so that we can better understand and anticipate the impacts that we\'re having on current ecosystems', '"\nThis is a point that Sam Arman agrees with', "He's hopeful that his current and future work might lead to ways to help modern-day kangaroos —

Australia today', 'Along with shorter faces, sthenurines had longer arms and a heavier build than their long-faced cousins', 'Many\nwalked on two feet\nlike a human or a\nTyrannosaurus rex', 'The

of a tiny area of the tooth surface, which can then be analysed using algorithms that quantify its texture', 'To see how microwear relates to diet, we compiled a massive baseline of modern macropods

they grow, and under what conditions', 'A new tool aims to make that easier', 'The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a\nnew guide\nearlier this month that chronicles more than 100 species of seaweed commonly found in Alaska', '“To grow it for the kelp industry, you need to know where you can find those spores, what time of year,” said Jordan Hollarsmith, a mariculture-focused research biologist with NOAA', '“Or if you want to harvest it, to eat it, you need to know what you’re looking for, where you can find that species', '”\nThe guide aims to advance the state’s budding mariculture industry at a time when global demand for kelp products is on the rise', 'Alaska mariculture is still tiny compared to other coastal states, like California, Oregon and Washington', 'But it is steadily gaining ground', 'All told, the state boasts more than 1,300 acres permitted for mariculture, according to a\nNOAA report\nfrom last year', 'And more mariculture farms are coming', 'On average, Alaska received more than a dozen applications for new sites each year between 2019 and 2023', 'That’s more than double the average for the five years prior', '“A decade ago, I don’t know if there was a single farm,” Hollarsmith said', '“And now we see multiple around Kodiak, some pretty small-scale ones in Kachemak Bay and in Prince William Sound, and then a few smaller, medium-sized ones and a large one as well in Southeast Alaska', '”\nHollarsmith didn’t author the updated guide', 'But she says it will be a crucial tool as the industry develops across the state', 'Right now, the highest concentration of mariculture is in Southeast, with forty permitted farms, according to the 2024 report', 'NOAA is also exploring where other farms might thrive', 'At one point that included the waters around Haines', 'But the agency later dropped Haines from the list because the area is near several state marine parks, which cannot overlap with farm lease applications, Alicia Bishop, a regional coordinator for NOAA Fisheries, said in an email', 'Siting new farms is one of the key obstacles to growth', 'That’s because new sites have to meet several key criteria, including the right environmental conditions and limited overlap with other marine activities', '“You can’t set your farm where there’s already a fishery, where there’s military installations, a ferry route, those sorts of things,” Hollarsmith said', 'Still, the industry is growing – and fast', 'That’s largely due to a $49 million federal grant awarded in 2022 to a coalition of companies, agencies, tribes and researchers working to boost the industry', 'NOAA\nsaid at the time\nthat the grant could help grow the industry to be worth nearly $2 billion within the next decade', 'A state task force, meanwhile, set a goal in 2016 to develop mariculture into a $100 million industry by 2040', 'Driving the state’s interest in part is the industry’s potential to boost Alaska’s coastal economies', 'Hollarsmith thinks mariculture could offer more opportunities for people already working on Alaska’s waterfronts', '“We see a lot of people that participate in commercial fisheries also participating in the mariculture industry,” she said', 'Hollarsmith says untapped opportunities for Alaskan oyster farms could also fuel growth', 'Kelp, meanwhile, is becoming an increasingly popular health food, and can also be used for other purposes', 'The industry is exploring how different species can be used as a strengthening ingredient in concrete, or in fertilizer to boost crop production', 'While the new field guide doesn’t focus on the quickly growing industry, it does provide detailed information about dozens of seaweed species commonly found in Alaska', 'That was made possible in part by new genetic techniques, like DNA sequencing, that have allowed researchers to better classify seaweed and identify new species over the last decade', '“It’s really important that we’re all using the same name to describe a given species,” Hollarsmith said', '“Especially in this time of kelp industry growth, when farmers are experimenting with new species and trying to understand what species are out there and what kind of benefits they might have', '” Spotlight\nWinter Waters celebrates seaweed on the Oregon Coast\nBy Zoe Buchli\nJan 31, 2025\n6 hrs ago\n0\n3 min to

seaweed farming', 'Oceans 2050, co-founded by environmental filmmaker Alexandra Cousteau and Chief Scientist Carlos Duarte, published its findings in Nature Climate Change', 'The study, titled “Carbon burial in sediments below seaweed farms matches that of Blue Carbon habitats,” marks the assessment of carbon burial rates beneath seaweed farms globally', 'The study, conducted across 20 seaweed farms covering five continents, confirmed that seaweed farming has the potential to sequester carbon in the sediments below at rates comparable to vegetated coastal ecosystems like mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses', "ET's Full Coverage of Carbon Capture Projects\nAlexandra Cousteau", 'Image credit Cancilleria Ecuador, courtesy Wikimedia Commons\n“This research provides compelling evidence of the critical role that seaweed farming can play in addressing the climate crisis,” Alexandra Cousteau, French environmentalist, president of Oceans 2050 and granddaughter of oceanographer and filmmaker Jacques-Yves Cousteau, said in a statement', '“By quantifying its carbon sequestration potential, we hope to unlock new avenues for investment in sustainable aquaculture as a climate solution', '”\nThe study touted that the “dual benefits” of seaweed farming includes food security and climate change mitigation', 'Many types of seaweeds are consumed as food', 'Among the key environmental findings in the Oceans 2050 study include that seaweed farms bury carbon at rates similar to mangroves and seagrasses, which are known for their climate benefits', 'The older and larger the seaweed farm, the more carbon it can store, according to the report', 'A 2022 Environmental Defense Fund\nreport on carbon sequestration by natural seaweed\nstands quoted earlier data that dissolved carbon removed by seaweed is slowly replaced by atmospheric CO2 resulting in a migration from carbon from the air into the ocean', 'Different types of seaweed process carbon differently, such as calcifying algae which releases a molecule of CO2 for every molecule of calcium carbonate that is produced, according to the EDF', 'Seaweed farming globally could remove up to 140 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually by 2050', 'That amount of removed C02 is equivalent to cutting emissions from 42 million passenger vehicles or more than 300 million barrels of oil consumed, according to the greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator of Natural Resources Canada', '“Seaweed farming offers a scalable, nature-based solution for carbon removal while delivering co-benefits such as biodiversity enhancement, economic opportunities, and food security,” added Duarte, lead author of the Oceans 2050 study', '“This research is a pivotal step towards integrating seaweed aquaculture into global climate strategies', '”\nThe Oceans 2050 group believes the study findings highlight the need for robust frameworks to develop carbon credits for seaweed farming, ensuring that this “Blue Carbon” strategy is allowed to be integrated into carbon markets', 'Seaweed farming has the potential to become a foundation of the regenerative Blue Economy by prioritizing marine spatial planning and sustainability', 'Expanded seaweed farming also could benefit economic balance considering that many participating farms are operated by women from coastal communities in developing countries, according to Oceans 2050', 'The Global Seaweed Project has been funded by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the Bezos Earth Fund through WWF, the Grantham Foundation, and Climateworks Foundation, to enable research and impactful initiatives', 'Blue carbon is a term\nfor carbon captured by the world’s ocean and coastal ecosystems, according to the U', 'S', 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration', '“The bigger picture of blue carbon is one of coastal habitat conservation,” reads the NOAA definition of blue carbon', '“When these systems are damaged, an enormous amount of carbon is emitted back into the atmosphere, where it can then contribute to climate change', 'So protecting and restoring coastal habitats is a good way to reduce climate change', '”\nMany strains of algae also are the focus of long-term research for carbon capture and utilization (CCU) benefits', 'A report in Science of the Total Environment contended that algae-driven CCU was promising as a tool for achieving carbon-neutrality goals such as net zero', 'For several decades, oil and gas producer Exxon Mobil worked on ways to cultivate algae and convert it into a feedstock for biofuel', 'In 2023,

six-fold increase in the amount of sargassum in the Atlantic Ocean was detected in December\nSargassum is a kind of seaweed that can grow into massive floating mats that provide food and habitat for marine animals\nWith 2025 expected to be a "massive sargassum year," a USF researcher says it is still unknown what affect it might have on Florida beaches\nA\nDecember report\nby the USF College of Marine Science Optical Oceanography Lab found an abundance of sargassum off the coast of Africa in the Eastern and Western Atlantic', 'Sargassum is a type of seaweed that can grow into massive floating mats that provide food and habitat for marine animals', 'But experts say too much could also be a problem, as the decomposition of sargassum on beaches can cause an unpleasant odor and possibly exacerbate respiratory issues', 'According to the report, in December, the sargassum exceeded 75% of its historical value', 'Researchers said thatâ\x80\x99s an indicator of what beachgoers could see on Floridaâ\x80\x99s Atlantic coast and near the Keys by the mid- to late spring', "University of South Florida optical oceanography professor Chuamin Hu is the report's lead researcher, and said several factors will determine where the sargassum will go", 'â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s driven by light, itâ\x80\x99s driven by temperature and it requires food,â\x80\x9d Hu said', 'â\x80\x9cAny

'Dulse is a clonal species, so when little bits break off, they keep growing; it doesn’t need to be fed or bred', 'As climate change strains global food systems, advocates such as Kieffer envision fast-growing seaweed as a food source for both people and livestock', 'Kieffer helped get the tanks up and running, then shifted to sales and promotion, knocking on doors, meeting with chefs and

research-server  |     "The waters of Southeast Alaska are an ideal environment to grow species ranging from Pacific oysters to ribbon kelp",
research-server  |     "But growing them successfully requires in-depth knowledge of dozens of species \u2014 where they grow, when they grow, and under what conditions",
research-server  |     "A new tool aims to make that easier",
research-server  |     "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a\nnew guide\nearlier this month that chronicles more than 100 species of seaweed commonly found in Alaska",
research-server  |     "\u201cTo grow it for the kelp industry, you need to know where you can find those spores, what time of year,\u201d said Jordan Hollarsmith, a mariculture-focused research biologist with NOAA",
research-server  |     "\u201cOr if you want to harvest it, to eat it, you need to know what you\u2019re looking for, where you can find that species",
research-server  |     "\u201d\nThe guide aims to advance the state\u2019s budding mariculture industry at a time when global demand for kelp products is on the rise",
research-server  |     "Alaska mariculture is still tiny compared to other coastal states, like California, Oregon and Washington",
research-server  |     "But it is steadily gaining ground",
research-server  |     "All told, the state boasts more than 1,300 acres permitted for mariculture, according to a\nNOAA report\nfrom last year",
research-server  |     "And more mariculture farms are coming",
research-server  |     "On average, Alaska received more than a dozen applications for new sites each year between 2019 and 2023",
research-server  |     "That\u2019s more than double the average for the five years prior",
research-server  |     "\u201cA decade ago, I don\u2019t know if there was a single farm,\u201d Hollarsmith said",
research-server  |     "\u201cAnd now we see multiple around Kodiak, some pretty small-scale ones in Kachemak Bay and in Prince William Sound, and then a few smaller, medium-sized ones and a large one as well in Southeast Alaska",
research-server  |     "\u201d\nHollarsmith didn\u2019t author the updated guide",
research-server  |     "But she says it will be a crucial tool as the industry develops across the state",
research-server  |     "Right now, the highest concentration of mariculture is in Southeast, with forty permitted farms, according to the 2024 report",
research-server  |     "NOAA is also exploring where other farms might thrive",
research-server  |     "At one point that included the waters around Haines",
research-server  |     "But the agency later dropped Haines from the list because the area is near several state marine parks, which cannot overlap with farm lease applications, Alicia Bishop, a regional coordinator for NOAA Fisheries, said in an email",
research-server  |     "Siting new farms is one of the key obstacles to growth",
research-server  |     "That\u2019s because new sites have to meet several key criteria, including the right environmental conditions and limited overlap with other marine activities",
research-server  |     "\u201cYou can\u2019t set your farm where there\u2019s already a fishery, where there\u2019s military installations, a ferry route, those sorts of things,\u201d Hollarsmith said",
research-server  |     "Still, the industry is growing \u2013 and fast",
research-server  |     "That\u2019s largely due to a $49 million federal grant awarded in 2022 to a coalition of companies, agencies, tribes and researchers working to boost the industry",
research-server  |     "NOAA\nsaid at the time\nthat the grant could help grow the industry to be worth nearly $2 billion within the next decade",
research-server  |     "A state task force, meanwhile, set a goal in 2016 to develop mariculture into a $100 million industry by 2040",
research-server  |     "Driving the state\u2019s interest in part is the industry\u2019s potential to boost Alaska\u2019s coastal economies",
research-server  |     "Hollarsmith thinks mariculture could offer more opportunities for people already working on Alaska\u2019s waterfronts",
research-server  |     "\u201cWe see a lot of people that participate in commercial fisheries also participating in the mariculture industry,\u201d she said",
research-server  |     "Hollarsmith says untapped opportunities for Alaskan oyster farms could also fuel growth",
research-server  |     "Kelp, meanwhile, is becoming an increasingly popular health food, and can also be used for other purposes",
research-server  |     "The industry is exploring how different species can be used as a strengthening ingredient in concrete, or in fertilizer to boost crop production",
research-server  |     "While the new field guide doesn\u2019t focus on the quickly growing industry, it does provide detailed information about dozens of seaweed species commonly found in Alaska",
research-server  |     "That was made possible in part by new genetic techniques, like DNA sequencing, that have allowed researchers to better classify seaweed and identify new species over the last decade",
research-server  |     "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we\u2019re all using the same name to describe a given species,\u201d Hollarsmith said",
research-server  |     "\u201cEspecially in this time of kelp industry growth, when farmers are experimenting with new species and trying to understand what species are out there and what kind of benefits they might have",

research-server  |     "Seaweed farms\n, for example, serve as powerful carbon sinks",
research-server  |     "Oyster farms sequester nitrogen and filter ocean water; adult Pacific oysters, like the ones that will be served by chef Maylin Ch\u00e1vez at a\nseaweed and oyster social\nat the Redd in Portland on February 18, filter about 50 gallons of water a day before they\u2019re harvested",

research-server  |     "Here on the coast, where we can reach out and touch the delicacies that will be plated and celebrated at Winter Waters, Kieffer calls us over to identify a wet, wrinkly patch of dark green nori",
research-server  |     "This one we all know from the dried sheet version sold in grocery stores",
research-server  |     "Nori is far from her favorite, so she moves on quickly to point out sugar kelp (great for wrapping fish to bake) and sea grapes (fun to squeeze like little water balloons, and which Kieffer once stuffed with ricotta, an achievement of creativity more than flavor)",
research-server  |     "We focus on a handful of the tastiest seaweeds, but more than 50 varieties grow in Oregon\u2019s rocky intertidal zone",

research-server  |     "It turns from reddish brown to bright green in a flash and tastes bright and smoky",
research-server  |     "Pacific dulse is found in the waters we just picked through, but this one comes from Oregon Seaweed, a land-based farm where dulse is grown in tanks year-round",
research-server  |     "(It will also be part of the March 2 tour",
research-server  |     ") Pre-pandemic, Kieffer worked at California\u2019s Catalina Island Marine Institute, where she taught shark biology and kayaking classes for kids and spent her free time swimming through the lush kelp forests just offshore",
research-server  |     "When COVID-19 hit, she moved to Seaside and soon caught wind that Oregon Seaweed, based in the\nSouth Coast\ntown of Bandon, was building a new site in Garibaldi, 200 miles north and closer to the bigger coastal cities and to Portland, where dulse was increasingly popping up on menus",
research-server  |     "In Kieffer's day job at Oregon Seaweed, she farms and sells Pacific dulse, which grows in 1,500-gallon tanks",
research-server  |     "Image:\nCourtesy Alanna Kiefer\nA land-based seaweed farm is a pretty simple operation, requiring minimal energy and resources to maintain",
research-server  |     "Water is pumped in from the ocean, filtered through a UV light, and then circulated with bubblers in 1,500-gallon tanks that hold the seaweed",
research-server  |     "Dulse is a clonal species, so when little bits break off, they keep growing; it doesn\u2019t need to be fed or bred",
research-server  |     "As climate change strains global food systems, advocates such as Kieffer envision fast-growing seaweed as a food source for both people and livestock",
research-server  |     "Kieffer helped get the tanks up and running, then shifted to sales and promotion, knocking on doors, meeting with chefs and restaurant owners, and encouraging them to add dulse to their dishes",
research-server  |     "When Oregon Seaweed needed a place to grind its\ndulse flakes\n, Kieffer had her studio apartment approved by the Oregon Department of Agriculture as a licensed processing facility, and the grinding machine sat on her kitchen table",
research-server  |     "The manual work was a mess, and despite hanging bed sheets and strategically positioning fans, seaweed dust coated everything",
research-server  |     "(The company has since outsourced the grinding",
research-server  |     ") She embarked on her own culinary experiments, too, draping long strands of it over cabinet doors to dry",
research-server  |     "Roasted dulse, prepared just like kale chips, became a favorite",

research-server  |     "Image:\nCourtesy Sophia Knox Photography\nFor my part, I never paid much attention to seaweed before Kieffer\u2019s workshop",
research-server  |     "But that day in Garibaldi, steeped in her enthusiasm for the vast expanse of edibles we\u2019re wading through, the ocean clicks into a different kind of focus",
research-server  |     "Back home, I tell my husband about the dulse-based chili crisp we sampled, and how easy it is to find this stuff in the wild, and does he think we should try making our own?

research-server  |     "Although challenges such as warming waters and extreme weather events affect many commercially farmed species, each species and market faces unique issues",
research-server  |     "To better understand the current state of global seaweed production, we can categorise these challenges into four key dimensions: temperate versus tropical seaweeds and emerging versus established farming regions",
research-server  |     "Short on time? Watch this summary video\nTemperate vs tropical seaweeds\nCultivating seaweed in the tropical belt is radically different compared to the temperate zones",
research-server  |     "Tropical seaweeds, such as Gracilaria and Eucheumatoids, allow for year-round production with growth cycles of only 30 to 45 days",
research-server  |     "This quick turnaround enables farmers to initiate, increase, or pause production in response to market trends or external factors",
research-server  |     "In contrast, temperate seaweeds are typically seasonal crops, primarily farmed during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in Southern Hemisphere",
research-server  |     "For example, kelps are seeded and harvested only once a year, with relatively short time windows for these activities",
research-server  |     "While Pyropia can be partially harvested throughout the season, it is highly perishable in its unprocessed form, necessitating processing facilities that can extend operations",
research-server  |     "Farmers of temperate species must thus meticulously plan ahead to ensure that their harvests align with market demand",
research-server  |     "Whether they\u2019re tropical or temperate has many other implications for the farming practices",
research-server  |     "Here are two of the more distinct ones:\nIn temperate zones, the seasonal nature of production requires a land-based hatchery stage to produce seed material for the following farming cycle",
research-server  |     "The\nland-based\nstage for temperate seaweed ensured investment into seedbanks and hatchery work, with the selection of the best-performing crop and improved seed material being available to farmers, either through cooperative hatchery operations (such as used in Japan) or privately owned hatchery operations (such ad used in South Korea)",
research-server  |     "In contrast, tropical seaweeds do not necessarily require this step and have predominantly relied on clonal propagation since farming began in the 1970s",
research-server  |     "The lack of a similar infrastructure for tropical seaweeds has resulted in a decreased pool of genetic diversity, making crops more vulnerable to pests, diseases and climate change effects",
research-server  |     "Most tropical seaweed farming regions - such as Indonesia (pictured above) - rely on manpower for landing harvested seaweed\nThis is in marked contrast to the mechanical means used by kelp farmers in regions like South Korea (see first image in this feature)\n\u00a9 Karlotta Rieve\nPain points for the seaweed industry differ in different regions (click on image to enlarge)\n\u00a9 Hatch Intelligence Services\nAnother significant difference is in post-harvest handling methods",
research-server  |     "Sun drying is the most common method for stabilising biomass in tropical regions due to high sunlight exposure year-round",
research-server  |     "However, this relatively low-cost technique often leads to minimal innovation in processing steps and product development",
research-server  |     "Furthermore, sun drying can destroy valuable compounds in the seaweed",
research-server  |     "On the other hand, temperate regions face challenges related to having short weather windows for harvesting large amounts of biomass simultaneously",
research-server  |     "This has driven farmers to explore diverse alternatives to drying \u2013 especially given the high energy requirements involved \u2013 leading to the exploration of more diverse and innovative product applications",
research-server  |     "Lastly, a strong differentiating factor between tropical and temperate seaweed farming lies in their socio-economic contexts",
research-server  |     "Tropical seaweed farming often occurs in developing countries within the global South and is dominated by smallholder farmers who operate small farms in less regulated environments",
research-server  |     "For many coastal communities in these regions, seaweed farming is one of the few sources of livelihood, increasing their dependency on this activity while also exposing them to exploitation risks",
research-server  |     "In contrast, temperate regions\u2014typically found in developed countries within the global North\u2014feature more company-type farming businesses due to more regulated access to farming",
research-server  |     "Farmers do have other economic opportunities, so seaweed becomes either a \u201cside gig\u201d as we witness in many North American emerging seaweed farming regions, or the next generations of farmers are lacking due to more attractive employment opportunities in the cities, such as the Japanese and South Korean trends show",
research-server  |     "Typical off-bottom tropical seaweed farm in Indonesia\n\u00a9 Karlotta Rieve\nEmerging vs established seaweed farming regions\nWhen comparing established versus emerging seaweed farming regions, we see that established areas tend to exhibit a market pull that facilitates scale",
research-server  |     "For instance, East Asia has a long-standing cultural appreciation for seaweed as a staple food source",
research-server  |     "Similarly, Southeast Asia has experienced increased global demand for carrageenan and agar derived from cultivated seaweeds",
research-server  |     "In both cases, markets were initially supplied by wild-harvested seaweed; however, demand quickly outpaced supply, justifying the development of farming",
research-server  |     "Conversely, many emerging seaweed farming regions perceive aquaculture as an opportunity for people, planet and profit but often lack a clear market pull to justify increased farming operations",
research-server  |     "This situation is frequently compounded by stringent regulatory environments due to the novelty of the activity and limited room for error",
research-server  |     "When seaweed farming began in now-established regions around 50 years ago, there were fewer regulations; now that these markets have matured, they tend to navigate existing businesses and supply chains",
research-server  |     "Hatch Innovation Services, in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy, recently conducted a deep dive into policy frameworks for seaweed aquaculture across emerging, growing, and established seaweed farming nations to provide policy recommendations for nations at different stages of their seaweed industry development",
research-server  |     "The second part of this article series will share some of the findings",
research-server  |     "In the third part, we will give our view on seaweed production trends",
research-server  |     "Since, of course there are also many nuances within the four categories presented here, we will go a bit more in-depth and share our predictions about where we can expect most of the seaweed biomass in the near future to come from",
research-server  |     "Conclusion\nTo conclude this part, I suggest that we should go beyond talking about one generic seaweed industry",
research-server  |     "While discussing specific species may not always be practical, the four dimensions are presented instead",
research-server  |     "This approach will elevate conversations among stakeholders who strive to address the challenges faced by their respective seaweed sectors and apply targeted solutions tailored to their unique contexts",
research-server  |     "The most significant challenges from our perspective can then be summarised in the following overview",
