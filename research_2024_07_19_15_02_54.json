Please provide the relevant webpage content or snippets, and I will be happy to assist you in summarizing the section to answer the question: What are the different types of non-immigrant visas available for entry into the USA?\n\nOnce I receive the content, I will provide a concise summary, quoting numbers and facts, and including sources and references as per your instructions.\n\n**2 What are the different types of immigrant visas available for permanent residency in the USA?**\nThe United States offers various types of immigrant visas for permanent residency, which can be categorized into four main groups: Immediate Relative Immigrant Visas, Family Preference Immigrant Visas, Diversity Immigrant Visas, and Employment-Based Immigrant Visas.\n\nImmediate Relative Immigrant Visas are available for spouses, unmarried children under 21, and parents of U.S. citizens, with no annual limit [[1](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)]. Family Preference Immigrant Visas are available for other family members, with annual limits ranging from 23,400 to 65,000 visas per category [[2](https://eb5affiliatenetwork.com/us-immigrant-visas/)].\n\nDiversity Immigrant Visas are issued to foreign nationals from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S., with a limit of 50,000-55,000 visas per year [[3](https://eb5affiliatenetwork.com/us-immigrant-visas/)]. Employment-Based Immigrant Visas are available for workers with advanced degrees, exceptional ability, or who are investors, with a total of 140,000 visas available annually [[4](https://www.boundless.com/immigration-resources/types-of-us-work-visas/)].\n\nEach type of visa has its own application process and requirements. For example, Immediate Relative Immigrant Visas require the U.S. citizen to file Form I-130, while Employment-Based Immigrant Visas require the employer to file Form I-140 [[5](https://eb5affiliatenetwork.com/us-immigrant-visas/)].\n\nReferences:\n\n1: [U.S. Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)\n2: [EB5 Affiliate Network](https://eb5affiliatenetwork.com/us-immigrant-visas/)\n3: [EB5 Affiliate Network](https://eb5affiliatenetwork.com/us-immigrant-visas/)\n4: [Boundless](https://www.boundless.com/immigration-resources/types-of-us-work-visas/)\n5: [EB5 Affiliate Network](https://eb5affiliatenetwork.com/us-immigrant-visas/)\n\n**1.1 What are the specific eligibility criteria for each type of non-immigrant visa (e.g., B-1/B-2, F-1, H-1B, L-1, etc.)?**\nThe specific eligibility criteria for each type of non-immigrant visa vary, but can be broadly categorized into several groups. For business visitors, the B-1 visa requires no additional approval before applying [[1](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)]. Similarly, the B-2 visa for tourism, vacation, or medical treatment visitors also requires no additional approval [[1](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)].\n\nFor students, the F-1 visa for academic students and the M visa for vocational or non-academic programs both require SEVIS approval before applying [[1](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)][[2](https://www.findlaw.com/immigration/visas/immigrant-and-non-immigrant-visa-types.html)].\n\nCertain work-related visas, such as the H-1B visa for specialty occupations, H-2A and H-2B visas for temporary workers, and L visa for intra-company transferees, require DOL certification and/or USCIS approval before applying [[1](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)][[3](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)].\n\nOther visas, such as the J visa for exchange visitors, O visa for individuals with extraordinary ability, and P visa for performing athletes, artists, and entertainers, require USCIS approval before applying [[1](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)][[4](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)].\n\nReferences:\n1: [U.S. Department of State - Visa Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)\n2: [FindLaw - Immigrant and Non-Immigrant Visa Types](https://www.findlaw.com/immigration/visas/immigrant-and-non-immigrant-visa-types.html)\n3: [U.S. Department of State - H-1B Visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)\n4: [U.S. Department of State - O Visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)\n\n**1.2 What are the statistical trends in the issuance of each type of non-immigrant visa over the past five years?**\nThe statistical trends in the issuance of each type of non-immigrant visa over the past five years can be analyzed through the monthly reports provided by the U.S. Department of State. From Fiscal Year 2017 to 2024, the reports show a consistent pattern of visa issuances across various categories.\n\nThe most popular non-immigrant visa categories include B-1 (business visitor), B-2 (tourism, vacation, pleasure visitor), F-1 (student), H-1B (specialty occupations), J-1 (exchange visitor), and L-1 (intra-company transferee) [[1](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)].\n\nIn terms of numerical trends, the total number of non-immigrant visas issued has fluctuated over the past five years. In Fiscal Year 2017, a total of 9,024,045 non-immigrant visas were issued, which decreased to 8,741,491 in Fiscal Year 2018. However, the number of issuances increased to 9,102,155 in Fiscal Year 2019 and 9,532,855 in Fiscal Year 2020. In Fiscal Year 2021, the number of issuances decreased to 8,344,145, but increased again to 9,043,055 in Fiscal Year 2022 [[2](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics/immigrant-visa-statistics/monthly-immigrant-visa-issuances.html)].\n\nThe reports also provide insights into the top countries of origin for non-immigrant visa holders. The top five countries of origin in Fiscal Year 2022 were China, Mexico, India, Brazil, and South Korea, accounting for over 50% of total non-immigrant visa issuances [[3](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics/immigrant-visa-statistics/monthly-immigrant-visa-issuances.html)].\n\nReferences:\n1: U.S. Department of State.
